ElementaryDataset
=================

The simple scenes for the study of motion perception.

Motivation
===============
This dataset is designed to support my research on Motion Anaysis and Representation. 


SinglePlane
  In this dataset, the only variable is the texture on the surface. Different scene share the same setting of camera, physical 3D scene, and lighting. 
  
  If our model work correctly. It should be able to represent the transformation shared by all scenes.
